    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I have been working on a hangman game using programming skills. I have learned many new things while working on this project. Using JavaScript, I have created the logic for the game where users can input a letter to guess the word. I have also used HTML and CSS to create the user interface for the game. The design of the game is visually appealing and user-friendly, making it an enjoyable experience for the players. I am constantly improving my coding skills and always looking for new ways to make my game more engaging and interactive. I am proud of my achievements with this hangman game and am excited to continue learning more about programming and making even more amazing projects.</p>
